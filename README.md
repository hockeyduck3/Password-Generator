# Password-Generator

* This is a simple password generator I made as a side project

* It's using HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and Javascript

* This password generator is using the Math.random method

* This site is currently live on github pages

This is just a little side project that I wanted to make. The Javascript is based off of the Javascript I wrote for my week 3 class assignment. Here is the link to that repo, https://github.com/hockeyduck3/week-3-hw

The design of this website is based off of the design I made for my Quiz Game assignment. The link for that repo is here, https://github.com/hockeyduck3/Quiz-Game

I really enjoyed making the password generator for my week 3 assignment, but I didn't like the design of the website, or just using alerts for all of the user inputs. So I decided to remake it using my own design and have it function in a more user friendly way.
